## Background:

This is a simple one-page website to give an introduction about myself and to showcase my skills and experiences. The website provides an overview  about me.

## Technology Used:
The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design is clean and modern, making it easy for users to quickly find the information they are looking for.

## Structure:
This website is made up of the following sections:

1. Header: Introduction (Introduction/ Profile Picture) 
2. About Me Section
3. Service Section 
4. Footer(Contact  / Social Networks)

The website is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive navigation system. Users can easily navigate between sections using the menu at the top of the page. 
I chose the following order for the information:
* About Me  
* Services 
* Contacts 
* Social Networks 

as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. I wanted users to be able to find information quickly. The navbar is also responsive and transforms into a hambureger menu wenn displayed on smaller display which gives a positive user experieance.

## Surface:
I chose a colour palette based around blues & grays as these colours i find appealing. I want the users to feel calm and at ease when visiting this website. Blue colors work calmly on people therefore the choice. I paired these with a lighter off-white to allow for appropriate contrast.

I used Google fonts Poppins across the entire website, I felt Poppins was a fun text and stood out on the page but I also wanted something easy to read.

## Features:
This is a fully responsive website and can be viewed on mobile, tablet, laptop. PC. The page is divided into the four sections listed in the navbar. Where a colour background has been used with a light blue color and the text is white/blue combination. All of the website  use the font poppins this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design.

### Navbar
The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. 

### About Me
This is where I introduce myself and the page and give a brief insight into why it was created. I wanted to keep this section simple and clean as there is plenty of information that follows.

### Services
This section explains which services i offer front end and backend.  

### Social Media / Contact
At the bottom of the page, there is a contact form that users can use to get in touch with me. They can also find my email address and links to my social media profiles. There can even schedule a meeting over calendly.

### Feedback
