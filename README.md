## Background

This is a simple one-page website to give an introduction about myself and to showcase my skills and experiences. The website provides an overview  about me.

# UX

## Structure
This website is made up of the following sections:

1. Header: Introduction (Introduction/ Profile Picture) 
2. About Me Section
3. Service Section 
4. Footer(Contact  / Social Networks)
## Surface
I chose a colour palette based around blues & grays as these colours i find appealing. I want the users to feel calm and at ease when visiting this website. Blue colors work calmly on people therefore the choice. I paired these with a lighter off-white to allow for appropriate contrast.

I used Google fonts Poppins across the entire website, I felt Poppins was a fun text and stood out on the page but I also wanted something easy to read.

## Features
This is a fully responsive website and can be viewed on mobile, tablet, laptop. PC. The page is divided into the four sections listed in the navbar. Where a colour background has been used with a light blue color and the text is white/blue combination. All of the website  use the font poppins this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design.

### Navbar

The website is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive navigation system. Users can easily navigate between sections using the menu at the top of the page.

The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. 
 
I chose the following order for the information:
* About Me  
* Services 
* Contacts 
* Social Networks 

as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. I wanted users to be able to find information quickly. The navbar is also responsive and transforms into a hambureger menu wenn displayed on smaller display which gives a positive user experieance.

### About Me
This is where I introduce myself and the page and give a brief insight into why it was created. I wanted to keep this section simple and clean as there is plenty of information that follows.

# Testing
## Lighthouse
Lighthouse is a feature of Google Chrome developer tools and is used to assess the performance of the website and its features. Please see assessment below:

I am very pleased to hit high scores in lighthouse assessment

## HTML and CSS Validation
I validated both my HTML and CSS code after building the website. It allowed me to incrementally improve my code and upon completion, there were 0 errors found.

## HTML Validator:

No errors found

## 404 Error Page
Added 404 error page for defensive design
If a user navigates to a page that does not exist on my website, they will encounter a 404 error page. It's important to provide a helpful and informative message on this page to assist users in finding the content they are looking for.

Used the followig tutorial to build the error message:

## Google Chrome Development Tools
Google Chrome DevTools where a powerful tool that  helped me in many ways, including testing the responsiveness of a website. When it comes to testing the responsiveness of a website, DevTools has several useful features that allowed me to adjust the screen size and simulate different devices, among other things.

One of the most useful features of DevTools for testing responsiveness is the device toolbar. This toolbar allowed me to simulate various devices with different screen sizes, including popular devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. By using the device toolbar, i could quickly check how the website looks and behaves on different devices.

Another useful feature of DevTools is the ability to adjust the screen size manually. I could drag the edge of the window to adjust the width of the screen, allowing me to see how the website responds to different screen sizes.

## Go Live extension from gitpod
The "Go Live" extension in Gitpod is a handy tool that allowed me to quickly launch a web server and preview my website or web application in the browser.

To use the Go Live extension in Gitpod, follow these steps:

1. Open your Gitpod workspace and ensure that your project is running.

2. Install go live extension.

3. Click on the "Go Live" icon in the bottom-left corner of the Gitpod window.

4. A new tab will open in your default browser, displaying the live version of your website or web application.

5. You can now interact with your website or web application as if it were deployed to a live server.

Any changes you make to your code will be immediately reflected in the browser. You can use Gitpod's built-in code editor to make changes and save your files.

When you are finished testing, you can close the browser tab and stop the web server by clicking on the "Stop" button in the Gitpod terminal.

The Go Live extension in Gitpod is a convenient way to test your website or web application without having to deploy it to a live server. It is especially useful during development, when you want to quickly preview changes without the hassle of deploying to a remote server.

Also i found that the changes made in the code where quicker showen in the browser than looking the changes  over (python3 -m http.server) command where the changes where showen with a little delay.

# Deployment

I deployed this website by using GitPages and following the below steps:

### GitHub pages deployment

1. Log in to GitHub
2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click 'Settings'
4. Select 'Pages' on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
5. In the source section, select branch 'Master' and save
6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75548207/234726724-4485dd8d-4a24-4668-a455-c0618db2253f.png)

Please note it can take a while for this link to become fully active.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

### Cloning the GitHub Repository

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the
clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.
