This is a simple one-page website to give an introduction to myself and showcase my skills and experiences. The website provides an overview  about me.

Technology Used
The website is built using HTML, CSS. The design is clean and modern, making it easy for users to quickly find the information they are looking for.

This website is made up of the following sections:

1.Header: Introduction (Introduction/ Profile Picture
2.About Me Section
3.Service Section 
4.Footer(Social Media / Contact)

Structure
The website is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive navigation system. Users can easily navigate between sections using the menu at the top of the page. I chose the following order for the information 'About Me > Services > Social Media/ Contacts', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. I wanted users to be able to find information quickly. The navbar is also responsive and transfors into a hambureger menu wenn displayed on smaller display which gives a positive user experieance.

Surface
I chose a colour palette based around lightblues & grays as these colours i find appealing; I want the users to feel calm and at ease when visiting this website. Lightblue colors work calmly on people therefore the choice. I paired these with a lighter off-white to allow for appropriate contrast.

I used Google fonts Poppins across the entire website, I felt Poppins was a fun text and stood out on the page but I also wanted something easy to read.

Features
This is a fully responsive website and can be viewed on mobile, tablet, laptop. PC; the page is divided into the four sections listed in the navbar. Where a colour background has been used withc a light blue color and the text is white/vlue combination. All of the website  use the font poppins this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design.

Navbar
The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. 

About Me
This is where I introduce myself and the page and give a brief insight into why it was created. I wanted to keep this section simple and clean as there is plenty of information that follows.

Services
This section explains which services i offer front end and backend.  

Social Media / Contact
At the bottom of the page, there is a contact form that users can use to get in touch with me. They can also find my email address and links to my social media profiles. There ean even schedule a meeting over calendly.
